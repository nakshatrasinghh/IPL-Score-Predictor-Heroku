**Summary**

The model was build by using the following [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/harsha547/indian-premier-league-csv-dataset). 
Deep Neural Networks, XGBoost and Random Forest was used to train the model. Random Forest gave us the best model metrics, so I converted it into a pickel file and saved it.
